    description: "The first-generation Subaru BRZ was developed as a joint venture between Subaru and Toyota (which sold its version as the GT86, Scion FR-S, or Toyota 86 depending on market), designed as a back-to-basics, lightweight sports coupe emphasizing handling balance and driver engagement over outright power. The name 'BRZ' stands for Boxer engine, Rear-wheel drive, and Zenith. Built on a unique platform with the engine placed low and far back in the chassis to achieve an exceptionally low center of gravity and near-perfect weight distribution, the BRZ featured Subaru's naturally aspirated 2.0-liter FA20 flat-four 'boxer' engine with Toyota's D-4S direct and port injection system, producing 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. Available with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission, the BRZ delivered 0-60 mph times of approximately 6.4 seconds—respectable but deliberately not class-leading, as the focus was on balanced handling rather than straight-line speed. The chassis featured MacPherson strut front suspension and double-wishbone rear suspension, with relatively narrow 215-width tires chosen specifically to allow controllable oversteer and enhance driver involvement. Weighing approximately 2,800 pounds, the BRZ was notably lighter than most contemporary sports cars. The exterior design featured classic sports car proportions with a long hood, low roofline, and short rear deck, while the 2+2 interior prioritized the driver with supportive sport seats, a small-diameter steering wheel, and simple, performance-oriented controls. A mid-cycle refresh in 2017 brought minor styling updates, revised suspension tuning, slight power increases for manual transmission models, and additional features including full-LED headlights. Special editions throughout the production run included the Series.Blue, Series.Yellow, and tS (tuned by STI) variants with unique styling elements and chassis refinements. The first-generation BRZ earned widespread acclaim from enthusiasts and automotive journalists for its pure driving experience in an era of increasingly computerized, high-horsepower sports cars, though some criticized its relative lack of torque and unchanging formula throughout its production run."

    description: "The second-generation Subaru BRZ maintains the fundamental philosophy of its predecessor—a lightweight, affordable rear-wheel-drive sports coupe emphasizing handling balance and driver engagement—while addressing key criticisms and modernizing the package. Still developed jointly with Toyota (whose version is now exclusively called the GR86), the new BRZ features more distinctive styling with a larger grille, functional side vents, and a more aggressive overall appearance while maintaining similar proportions to the original. Addressing the most common complaint about the first generation, the BRZ now features a larger 2.4-liter FA24 naturally aspirated flat-four 'boxer' engine producing 228 horsepower and a more substantial 184 lb-ft of torque, with the torque peak occurring at a more accessible 3,700 rpm compared to the high-revving character of the previous engine. Available again with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission, the new BRZ offers improved acceleration with 0-60 mph times reduced to around 5.8 seconds for manual transmission models. Despite the larger engine, curb weight increases only marginally to approximately 2,815-2,881 pounds depending on configuration, thanks to the use of aluminum for the roof, hood, and fenders. The chassis features increased rigidity, with front lateral bending rigidity improved by 60 percent for more responsive handling. The interior has been modernized with a 7-inch digital instrument cluster featuring a unique track-focused display mode, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and improved materials while maintaining the driver-focused layout. For the first time, automatic transmission models include Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance system with adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, and lane departure warning, though this is not available with the manual transmission. The second-generation BRZ continues to offer a relatively rare proposition in the modern automotive landscape: an affordable, purpose-built sports car that prioritizes driver involvement over outright performance figures or luxury features, now with enough additional power and refinement to address the main criticisms of its well-regarded predecessor."
